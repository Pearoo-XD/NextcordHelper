# NextcordHelper

NextcordHelper is a fork of [Discord Tools](https://github.com/Darkempire78/Discord-Tools). If you want to use discord.py instead of nextcord, please use Discord Tools instead of NextcordHelper.

[**GitHub**](https://github.com/Pearoo-XD/NextcordHelper) - [**VSC Marketplace**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Darkempire78.discord-tools) - [**Open VSX**](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Darkempire78/discord-tools/1.4.3)

## Features

### [BETA] Discord chat in VSCode: 
⚠️ **This feature is currently in BETA, so it is possible that some features are not yet implemented and you may find bugs. If you find an error, report it to Darkempire78 (OC), not me, because I can't develop it. Thank you for reporting it [here](https://github.com/Darkempire78/Discord-Tools/issues/new)**.

⚠️ It seems that the way this extension works is not entirely within Discord's terms of service. See the [Discord's terms](https://discord.com/terms) for more.
However, please note that this extension does not collect personal information and does not automatically respond to messages! **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

#### Instalation
You must set up your personal Discord token with the command: `Discord Chat: Set up your personal Discord token`

You can find your Discord token with the command: `Discord Chat: Grab your personal Discord Token`. However, if this does not work, you can follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI).

#### Features
* Discord Chat
* Navigation tree through the servers (DM will be supported in the future)
* Parameters
